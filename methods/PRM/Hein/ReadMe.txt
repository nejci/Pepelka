Intrinsic Dimensionality Estimation
===================================

This code estimates the intrinsic dimension of a dataset. It
calculates three estimates. The estimator by the authors which was
proposed in

Intrinsic dimensionality estimation of submanifolds in Euclidean space
Proceedings of the 22nd ICML, 289-296, Eds. L. de Raedt and S. Wrobel, 2005

and two classical estimators: the correlation dimension and the Takens estimator
(see the paper for references).

Two possible implementations are available. The first one is C-Code and the other
one is a mex-file for the usage in MATLAB.

The usage of this code is allowed for scientific purposes. If you use this code
please cite the above paper.

C-Code
======
The C-code has two possible options of inputs.

In the first option the user provides a data file. In the second
one the data is generated by the program.

First option - Data is loaded from a file
  argument 1: name of the file with the data
             where the file should have the following format:
             Binary, float, and data points p are written sequentially
             that is p[0][0],...,p[0][dim-1],p[1][0],....
  argument 2: datatype  - c, uc, l , ul, f, d
                      - char, unsigned char, long, unsigned long, float, double
  argument 3: dimension of the data
  argument 4: upper bound on the dimension to be estimated (<=dim)
            can usually limited to something below ~500 (default)

  Example:
  GetDim C:\\usps.BIN uc 256 30

    The data is located in the file usps.BIN
    The binary data is stored as unsigned char
    The dimension of each data point is 256 (USPS has 16x16 images)
    The maximal dimension which can be estimated is limited to 30

Second option - Data is generated by the program
  argument 1: number of the dataset
  argument 2: dimension of the dataset
  argument 3: number of points
  argument 4: number of runs

  see the Matlab Mex-File for a description of the possible datasets
  The dimension of the dataset is the dimension of the ambient space not the
  intrinsic dimension.

  Example:
  GetDim 0 200 5000 100

    The program tries to estimate 100 times the dimension of a dataset of 5000 points
    generated from the dataset 0, where the dimension of the ambient space is supposed to be 200.
    (Note that for several datasets the dimension of the ambient space cannot be chosen e.g. in the
    case of dataset 0, the sinusoid on the circle in R^3, the ambient space has a fixed dimension of 3.
    In this case the option dimension has no effect.)

IMPORTANT NOTE: To save time the maximal number of dimension is limited to 500 for the intrinsic dimensionality
                estimator.

Matlab Mex-Files
================

GetDim:
This is a mex-file for Matlab. Go to the directory where you have copied the downloaded files.
Then use the command
 mex GetDim.cpp
to compile the file.

Let X be the matrix of the data points, where one column corresponds to one data point, then
use
   GetDim(X)

to estimate the intrinsic dimension. The matrix can be sparse or full.

Output are three numbers:
The estimate for the intrinsic dimension, the correlation dimension, the Takens estimator

IMPORTANT NOTE: To save time the maximal number of dimension is limited to 500 for the intrinsic dimensionality
                estimator.

GenerateManifoldData:
If you want to use some datasets from the paper (and more) you can use the second mex-file

mex generateManifoldData

generateManifoldData has three inputs
1) The number of the dataset
2) The dimension of the dataset (dimension of the ambient space)
3) The number of points

e.g. generateManifoldData(0,200,5000)
generates 5000 data points of dataset 0 of dimension 3 (the dimension 200 is ignored since the dimension
is fixed for this dataset)

Here is a description of the possible datasets (*) indicates if it was used in the paper:
0: sinusoid over the circle with high curvature (*) (dimension fixed)
1: a dim-1 dimensional sphere (uniformly sampled) (*)
2: a 3d-affine space in 5d (dimension fixed)
3: a strange 4-dim figure in 5d (but very concentrated so it is ess 3d) (dimension fixed)
4: a 4-dim manifold in 8 dimensions           (dimension fixed)
5: a 2d helix in 3d                           (dimension fixed)
6: a 6-dim manifold in 36 dimensions          (dimension fixed)
7: "swiss roll"                               (dimension fixed)
8: 12-dim manifold in 72 dimensions (*)       (dimension fixed)
9: A 20-dim affine space in 20-dimensions     (dimension fixed)
10: k-hypercube, uniformly sampled
11: Moebius band, 10 times twisted (*)        (dimension fixed)
12: Multivariate Gaussian (*)
13: one-dimensional curve in dim dimensions


You can repeat the experiments of the paper using the matlab function Dimension_Exp

Usage: Dimension_Exp(set)
where the possible sets are
1: Sinusoid
2: Sphere
3: Gaussian distribution with full support
4: Moebius strip
5: 12-dimensional submanifold of R^72

Note that the data files Sinusoid_*.BIN, S*_*.BIN, Gauss*_*.BIN, Moebius_*.BIN and M12_*.BIN
and the compiled mex file GetDim need to be in the same directory as Dimension_Exp.

Note that the result reported in the paper for the 800 runs for the 12-dimensional submanifold
is actually the one for 600 runs, the correct result for 800 is 74/71/77.
