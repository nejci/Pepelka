function [labels, moreInfo]=pplk_clustererCL(data,K,params)

% params.CL_distance can be:
%         'euclidean'   - Euclidean distance
%         'seuclidean'  - Standardized Euclidean distance, each coordinate
%                         in the sum of squares is inverse weighted by the
%                         sample variance of that coordinate
%         'cityblock'   - City Block distance
%         'mahalanobis' - Mahalanobis distance
%         'minkowski'   - Minkowski distance with exponent 2
%         'cosine'      - One minus the cosine of the included angle
%                         between observations (treated as vectors)
%         'correlation' - One minus the sample linear correlation between
%                         observations (treated as sequences of values).
%         'spearman'    - One minus the sample Spearman's rank correlation
%                         between observations (treated as sequences of values).
%         'hamming'     - Hamming distance, percentage of coordinates
%                         that differ
%         'jaccard'     - One minus the Jaccard coefficient, the
%                         percentage of nonzero coordinates that differ
%         'chebychev'   - Chebychev distance (maximum coordinate difference)
