------- BRIEF -------------------------------------------------------------
This package computes the modified Dunn's cluster validity index 
using shortest paths in the neighbourhood graph (Ilc, 2012). It also includes 
Generalized Dunn's index (Pal & Biswas, 1997) and a bunch of algorithms for
graph building.

Best cluster partition maximizes the index value.


------- HOW TO USE -------------------------------------------------------
1)	Run script file 'demo' to see illustrative example.

2)	Run function 'indexDNs' (or 'indexDNg') with specified parameters.
    This function builds a graph on input data. If the graph has been 
    already built, you should run 'indexDNs_graph' (or 'indexDNg_graph')
    instead to bypass (slow) computing of the graph.

3)  Type 'help indexDNs' or 'help indexDNg' to get a list of the parameters 
    and their description.
