% Calculates the Euclidean distance between vectors [FAST].
%
% Assume X is an m-by-p matrix representing m points in p-dimensional space and Y is an
% n-by-p matrix representing another set of points in the same space. This function
% compute the m-by-n distance matrix D where D(i,j) is the SQUARED Euclidean distance
% between X(i,:) and Y(j,:).  Running time is O(m*n*p).
%
% If x is a single data point, here is a faster, inline version to use:
%   D = sum( (Y - ones(size(Y,1),1)*x).^2, 2 )';
%
% INPUTS
%   X   - m-by-p matrix of m p dimensional vectors 
%   Y   - n-by-p matrix of n p dimensional vectors 
%
% OUTPUTS
%   D   - m-by-n distance matrix
%
% EXAMPLE
%   X=[randn(100,5)]; Y=randn(40,5)+2;
%   D = dist_euclidean( [X; Y], [X; Y] ); im(D)
